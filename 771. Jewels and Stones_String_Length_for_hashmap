771. Jewels and Stones
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0


var numJewelsInStones = function(jewels, stones) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i=0; i<stones.length; i++){
        if (jewels.indexOf(stones[i]) != -1)
            count++;
    }
    return count;
};

var numJewelsInStones = function(jewels, stones) {
    const hashmap = new Map();
    let output = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < jewels.length; i++) {
        const jewel = jewels[i];
        hashmap.set(jewel, i);
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < stones.length; i++) {
        const stone = stones[i];
        if(hashmap.has(stone)) output++;
    }
    
    return output;
};

var numJewelsInStones = function(jewels, stones) {
    let count=0;
    for(let i in jewels){
        for(let j in stones){
            if(jewels[i]==stones[j]) count=count+1
        }
    }
    return count;
};
